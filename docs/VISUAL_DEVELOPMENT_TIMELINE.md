## Screenshot Instructions

### For Taking Screenshots:
1. **Browser window**: Capture full browser window including URL bar
2. **Resolution**: Use consistent window size for all screenshots
3. **Timing**: For animated elements (progress bar), capture at meaningful moments
4. **Data**: Use realistic test data that demonstrates functionality
5. **Console**: For development screenshots, show VS Code with relevant files open

### File Naming Convention:
- `01_initial_setup.png`
- `02_css_styling.png`
- `03_map_integration.png`
- `04_location_detection.png`
- `05_api_integration.png`
- `06_emergency_mode.png`
- `07_location_selection.png`
- `08_complete_analysis.png`

### Optimal Screenshot Timing:
- **Screenshot 5**: Take during or just after successful API call
- **Screenshot 6**: Capture with progress bar around 60-80% complete
- **Screenshot 8**: Show completed calculation with all data populated

### Test Scenarios for Screenshots:
- **Inland testing**: Use Houston coordinates for wind-only mode demonstration
- **Marine testing**: Use Galveston Bay or Offshore mode for full marine calculations
- **Emergency timing**: Let emergency timer run for 2-3 minutes for realistic display

### Additional Documentation Screenshots:
Consider capturing additional development views:
- VS Code showing project structure
- Browser developer console showing successful API calls
- Mobile view of the application
- Error handling scenarios

This timeline shows the evolution from basic HTML structure to a sophisticated maritime rescue application with real-time data integration, location intelligence, and professional emergency response capabilities.
